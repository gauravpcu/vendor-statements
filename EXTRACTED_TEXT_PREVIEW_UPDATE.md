# Extracted Text Preview Enhancement

## 🎯 **What You Requested**
You wanted to see the **parsed/extracted content** from uploaded files (PDF, Excel, CSV) displayed as text on screen, not the raw file structure.

## ✅ **What I've Implemented**

### **Backend Changes** (`app.py`)

#### **Enhanced Preview Route** (`/preview_file/<filename>`):
- **Uses same extraction logic** as the upload process
- **Extracts actual parsed content** using `extract_headers()` and `extract_data()`
- **Creates text representation** of the parsed data
- **Shows parsing status** and statistics

#### **Text Format Example**:
```
=== PARSED EXCEL CONTENT ===
File: invoice_data.xlsx
Headers Found: 5
Total Rows: 25

HEADERS:
  1. Invoice ID
  2. Invoice Date
  3. Amount
  4. Vendor Name
  5. Due Date

SAMPLE DATA (First 10 rows):
Row 1:
  Invoice ID: INV-001
  Invoice Date: 2024-01-15
  Amount: $1,250.00
  Vendor Name: Acme Corp
  Due Date: 2024-02-15

Row 2:
  Invoice ID: INV-002
  Invoice Date: 2024-01-16
  Amount: $850.00
  Vendor Name: Beta LLC
  Due Date: 2024-02-16
...
```

### **Frontend Changes** (`upload.js`)

#### **Enhanced Preview Modal**:
- **Shows extracted text content** in a scrollable text area
- **Displays parsing status** (success/error information)
- **Headers as numbered badges** for quick reference
- **Copy to clipboard** functionality for the extracted text
- **Professional styling** with monospace font for data

#### **Key Features**:
- ✅ **Extracted text display** - Shows the actual parsed content as text
- ✅ **Parsing status** - Shows if extraction was successful
- ✅ **Copy functionality** - One-click copy of all extracted text
- ✅ **Header overview** - Quick reference of detected headers
- ✅ **File statistics** - Size, type, row count, header count

## 🔧 **How It Works**

### **For CSV Files**:
1. Uses `extract_headers()` to get column names
2. Uses `extract_data()` to get actual data rows
3. Formats as readable text with headers and sample data

### **For Excel Files**:
1. Uses same extraction logic as upload process
2. Handles skip_rows and header detection
3. Shows parsed content, not raw Excel structure

### **For PDF Files**:
1. Uses cached PDF extraction data if available
2. Falls back to `extract_headers_from_pdf_tables()` if needed
3. Shows extracted tabular data as text

## 🎨 **Visual Improvements**

### **Before** (Raw File Preview):
- Showed raw file structure
- Table format only
- No text representation

### **After** (Extracted Content Preview):
- Shows parsed content as readable text
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Parsing status information
- Professional monospace formatting

## 📋 **Usage**

1. **Upload any file** (PDF, Excel, CSV)
2. **Click "👁️ Preview File"** button
3. **See extracted content** displayed as formatted text
4. **Copy text** if needed for external use
5. **View parsing status** to understand extraction success

## 🎯 **Benefits**

### **For Users**:
- **See exactly what was extracted** from their files
- **Understand parsing results** before applying templates
- **Copy extracted content** for external use
- **Verify data quality** before processing

### **For Debugging**:
- **Identify parsing issues** immediately
- **See header detection results** clearly
- **Understand skip_rows effects** on extraction
- **Verify template application** results

## 🚀 **Result**

Now when you click "👁️ Preview File", you'll see:

1. **📄 Parsed Content: filename.xlsx**
2. **📋 Parsing Status: Successfully parsed Excel with 5 headers and 25 rows**
3. **📝 Extracted Content** - Full text representation of the parsed data
4. **🏷️ Detected Headers** - Numbered badges showing all headers
5. **📋 Copy Extracted Text** - Button to copy all content

This gives you complete visibility into what the system extracted from your files, exactly as it will be used for processing! 🎉

The preview now shows the **actual parsed content as text**, not raw file structure, making it much more useful for understanding what data was extracted and how it will be processed.
