# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for creating comprehensive documentation for the Vendor Statements Processing System. The system is a full-stack application that processes vendor statements from various file formats (PDF, CSV, Excel) and standardizes the data using AI-powered field mapping. The current documentation is minimal and scattered, requiring a complete overhaul to support developers, users, and system administrators.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer joining the project, I want comprehensive technical documentation, so that I can understand the system architecture and contribute effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer accesses the documentation THEN the system SHALL provide detailed architecture diagrams showing component relationships
2. WHEN a developer needs to understand data flow THEN the system SHALL provide sequence diagrams for key processes
3. WHEN a developer wants to set up the development environment THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step setup instructions with prerequisites
4. WHEN a developer needs to understand the codebase THEN the system SHALL provide module-level documentation with clear API references

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want deployment and configuration documentation, so that I can deploy and maintain the system in different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator needs to deploy the system THEN the documentation SHALL provide environment-specific deployment guides
2. WHEN an administrator configures the system THEN the documentation SHALL provide comprehensive configuration reference with examples
3. WHEN an administrator troubleshoots issues THEN the documentation SHALL provide troubleshooting guides with common problems and solutions
4. WHEN an administrator monitors the system THEN the documentation SHALL provide monitoring and logging configuration guides

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an end user, I want user-friendly documentation, so that I can effectively use the system to process vendor statements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user first accesses the system THEN the documentation SHALL provide a quick start guide with basic workflows
2. WHEN a user processes different file types THEN the documentation SHALL provide format-specific processing guides
3. WHEN a user manages templates THEN the documentation SHALL provide template creation and management instructions
4. WHEN a user encounters errors THEN the documentation SHALL provide user-friendly error resolution guides

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want API documentation, so that I can understand and maintain the system's interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a maintainer needs API reference THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive API documentation with request/response examples
2. WHEN a maintainer updates endpoints THEN the documentation SHALL provide guidelines for maintaining API compatibility
3. WHEN a maintainer integrates with external services THEN the documentation SHALL provide integration guides and examples
4. WHEN a maintainer needs to understand data models THEN the documentation SHALL provide detailed schema documentation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security auditor, I want security documentation, so that I can assess and validate the system's security posture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an auditor reviews the system THEN the documentation SHALL provide security architecture and threat model documentation
2. WHEN an auditor checks authentication THEN the documentation SHALL provide authentication and authorization flow documentation
3. WHEN an auditor validates data handling THEN the documentation SHALL provide data security and privacy documentation
4. WHEN an auditor reviews configurations THEN the documentation SHALL provide security configuration guidelines

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want business documentation, so that I can understand the system's capabilities and business value.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a stakeholder evaluates the system THEN the documentation SHALL provide business overview and value proposition
2. WHEN a stakeholder plans usage THEN the documentation SHALL provide feature documentation with business benefits
3. WHEN a stakeholder considers scaling THEN the documentation SHALL provide performance and scalability documentation
4. WHEN a stakeholder budgets resources THEN the documentation SHALL provide operational cost and resource requirement documentation
