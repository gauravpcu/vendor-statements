# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Invoice Matching Database Integration feature enables the system to connect to internal or external invoice databases and perform intelligent matching of invoices based on key identifiers. This feature will provide automated invoice verification capabilities by comparing extracted invoice data against existing database records and classifying the results based on match quality and completeness.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure database connections for invoice matching, so that the system can access invoice databases for verification purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a database connection is configured THEN the system SHALL validate the connection parameters and establish connectivity
2. WHEN multiple database types are supported THEN the system SHALL provide configuration options for different database engines (SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle)
3. WHEN API-based connections are configured THEN the system SHALL support REST API endpoints with authentication
4. IF connection fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error messages and provide troubleshooting guidance
5. WHEN connection credentials are stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data processor, I want the system to match invoices by key identifiers, so that I can verify invoice authenticity and detect duplicates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an invoice is processed THEN the system SHALL attempt to match by invoice number as the primary identifier
2. WHEN invoice number matching is performed THEN the system SHALL also validate customer/facility name, vendor name, and invoice date
3. WHEN multiple matching criteria are used THEN the system SHALL apply fuzzy matching algorithms for name variations
4. WHEN date matching is performed THEN the system SHALL allow configurable tolerance ranges (Â±N days)
5. IF no exact match is found THEN the system SHALL attempt partial matching with reduced criteria

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to receive clear classification results for invoice matches, so that I can make informed decisions about invoice processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a perfect match is found THEN the system SHALL classify the result as "Found" with all matching details
2. WHEN no match exists THEN the system SHALL classify the result as "Not Found" with search criteria used
3. WHEN partial matches are detected THEN the system SHALL classify as "Partial Match" with specific discrepancy details
4. WHEN amount discrepancies exist THEN the system SHALL report the variance amount and percentage difference
5. WHEN multiple partial matches exist THEN the system SHALL rank them by confidence score

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want comprehensive logging and error handling for database operations, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL log query performance metrics
2. WHEN connection errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
3. WHEN matching operations fail THEN the system SHALL continue processing other invoices without system failure
4. IF database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL queue matching requests for later processing
5. WHEN matching results are generated THEN the system SHALL log match confidence scores and criteria used

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want audit trails for all invoice matching activities, so that I can track verification processes and maintain regulatory compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invoice matching is performed THEN the system SHALL create audit records with timestamps and user context
2. WHEN match results are classified THEN the system SHALL store the classification reasoning and confidence metrics
3. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL log the specific search criteria and results count
4. IF sensitive data is accessed THEN the system SHALL mask or encrypt personally identifiable information in logs
5. WHEN audit data is stored THEN the system SHALL implement data retention policies based on compliance requirements

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a performance analyst, I want configurable matching algorithms and thresholds, so that I can optimize matching accuracy for different business scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fuzzy matching is configured THEN the system SHALL allow adjustment of similarity thresholds (0-100%)
2. WHEN matching criteria weights are set THEN the system SHALL apply different importance levels to invoice number, vendor, customer, and date
3. WHEN confidence scoring is calculated THEN the system SHALL use configurable algorithms (weighted average, machine learning models)
4. IF matching performance is poor THEN the system SHALL provide analytics on false positives and false negatives
5. WHEN matching rules are updated THEN the system SHALL apply changes without requiring system restart
