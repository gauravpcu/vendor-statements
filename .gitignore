# Uploads directory - if it's not meant to be in the repo

# If uploads should be versioned (e.g. for default examples), then remove above line.
# For this project, we've been treating it as a runtime-created dir.

# Learned preferences and templates storage - if these are user-specific and not default examples

# If these directories should contain default examples to be versioned, then remove above lines.
# Given they store user-generated content, they are good candidates for .gitignore.
