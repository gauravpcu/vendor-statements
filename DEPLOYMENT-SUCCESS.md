## 🧪 Testing Results

### Health Checks ✅
- **Basic Health:** `http://44.213.147.151:8000/health` → 200 OK
- **Detailed Health:** `http://44.213.147.151:8000/healthz` → JSON response
- **Main Application:** `http://44.213.147.151:8000` → Web interface loads

### Functionality Tests ✅
- **File Upload:** CSV, Excel, PDF files process successfully
- **AI Field Mapping:** Azure OpenAI integration working
- **Template Management:** Save/load templates to/from S3
- **Data Processing:** Field extraction and validation working
- **Storage Integration:** S3 bucket accessible and functional

## 💰 Cost Estimate

### Monthly Costs (24/7 operation)
- **EC2 t3.medium:** ~$30/month
- **EBS Storage (30GB):** ~$3/month
- **S3 Storage:** ~$1-5/month (depending on usage)
- **Data Transfer:** ~$1-10/month (depending on traffic)

**Total Estimated Cost:** ~$35-50/month

### Cost Optimization
- Stop instance when not in use (pay only for running time)
- Use smaller instance type for development/testing
- Set up billing alerts for cost monitoring
